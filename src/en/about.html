</div>

<p>
    The Chinese Taipei Touch Association (CTTA), also known as Taiwan Touch Association, is the governing body for TOUCH
    in the ROC (Taiwan), and is affiliated to the Federation of International Touch (FIT). Touch is a field sport also
    known in some countries as Touch Football, or Touch Rugby. Touch is overseen worldwide by the Federation of
    International Touch (FIT).
    Touch is played internationally and features many regional and global competitions. There have been seven Touch
    World Cups, the latest in Scotland in June 2011.

    Touch has a history in rugby league and in rugby union, with the tackling of opposing players replaced by a touch.
    Touch is therefore not a contact sport but a limited-contact sport.
    Distinctive features of Touch include the ease of learning, minimal equipment requirements and the ability to play
    it without fear of major injury.

    While it is generally played with two teams of six on-field players, some social competitions allow different number
    of players per team on the field.
    It is played by both sexes, and in age divisions from primary school children to over-50s. The mixed version of the
    game (where both male and female players are on the field at the same time) is particularly popular with social
    players, and it is widely played in schools.
